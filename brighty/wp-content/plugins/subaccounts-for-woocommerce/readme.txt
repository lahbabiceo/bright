== Description ==

Subaccounts for WooCommerce allows the creation of subaccounts for your customers and subscribers within WooCommerce.

The ability to create multiple subaccounts tied to a main/parent account is extremely useful in all of the following usage scenarios:

* companies that need to add and manage accounts for their employees
* stores that need to place orders from different branches
* businesses with multiple decision-makers for purchases
* when parent accounts need to supervise and monitor all the activities made by their own subaccounts (purchases, expenses, quotes, etc.) and even place orders on behalf of them;
* in the case of company accounts that need to place orders from different purchasing departments or through multiple purchasing managers (B2B and similar);
* in those situations where a sales agent or sales representative needs to create new accounts for newly acquired customers and, if desired, place orders on their behalf.
